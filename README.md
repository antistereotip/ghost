## Ghost 1337
*Ghost protocol.* 
*Ghost will start at year 2025 at 13:37 RIP Danilo Bogdanov.*
*The first invisible protocol in the history of the Internet.*
*Idea is also to make Ghost Programming Language Feature for Protocol (gplfp.gh).*
*Fasten your seat belt, let's take off...*

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of 
the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0, respectively.[1] Instead of 
elementary algebra, where the values of the variables are numbers and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction (and) denoted as ∧, the disjunction (or) denoted as ∨, and the negation (not) denoted as ¬. It is thus a formalism for describing logical operations, in the same way that elementary algebra describes numerical operation.
