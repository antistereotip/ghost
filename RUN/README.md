## INTRO
- The development should move in the direction of big data and the algorithms that that data solves.
- The algorithm that would determine the complexity of big data could range from a few Megabytes to a few Petabytes, the data itself, while the algorithms should be solved by distributed systems of networked computers. From Level Up, to Level Out.
- The network structure should have a combination of programming language C, LISP, GO and BASH and Python exclusively in the FreeBsd operating system.
- Use C and LISP for the file system while BASH and Python and GO will be used in programming the environment and high level aplication level. 
- No database usage
- Only ssh connection and telnet connection will be available to the application, but at the admin level. BBS (Synhronet) included for admin (core) team only.
- Telnet access into intern core system, fully open source for core team (4 nibbles - 0000, 1111, 1001, 0110).
- Algorithm wil be written in ANSI C. That Algorithm will be work with big data structures and complexity. Just core team will be users of system and alghoritm.
- Core users (0000, 1111, 1001, 0110) will command all other 1111 software engineers. Everyone else, except the Core team, will have their connections and their data will come filtered and completely decrypted. An excellent team of 1111 people is very complex when each user can start [n] processes at a higher level. GO is ANSI C of 21 century :) Make it GO :)
### My definition BIG DATA: 
- Big Data moze biti 1MB, 1PB or 1ZB 1nB.
- Depending on the complexity and content of the data itself, no matter how much it is, it is sometimes harder to solve 1MG of quality code, minimized and complex at the same time, than to handle 50 PT movies to orchestrated servers. 
- And at the same time very well coded in a bunch of abbreviations for using a library.
### Ghost Protocol Programming Module, Construction of Security Programming language
- Ghost as a .ghs syntax will be used as a security program module. It will have syntax like almost any programming language but will be focused on trained matrices. An API will be created that will pull all program modules. Ghost should be something like a Feature of any language.
### Syntax of matrices
#### Array:
`$eng->sadrzaj = array( 
	array(
	"0000" => "data1",
	"1111" => "data2",
	"0110" => "data3",
	"1001" => "data4"
	),
	array(
	"1001" => "data5",
	"1111" => "data6",
	"0110" => "data7",
	"0000" => "data8"
	),
	array(
	"0000" => "data9",
	"1001" => "data10",
	"1111" => "data11",
	"0110" => "data12"
	)
);`

## Quantum Logic

Quantum computers functionally use the quantum properties of microparticles. In classical computers, 
information is basically represented in the form of bits (0 and 1) where one information at a time 
can be either 0 or 1. In quantum computers, the basic units of operation are qubits (qbit), which use
the quantum superposition phenomenon and other quantum properties for information operation. This means 
that the qubit can have multiple states of zero and one (0, 1, 01, 00, 10, 11), because each of these 
states can be in superposition, which gives the qubit multidimensionality. What is interesting about 
the quantum bit is that it can have a possible state (0, 1, 01, 00, 10, 11) only and exclusively only 
if we do not observe it. The moment we start observing it, it transforms into a state of ordinary bit, 
where only zero or one state is possible. This means that quantum calculations take place outside our 
perception, and the moment we get involved in requesting that information that the quantum computer 
has processed, we actually get only a simple bit as output. According to some, this happens, among other 
things, because the human brain and body are not ready or accustomed to the state of particle superposition. 
It can be understandably said that this phenomenon is a matter of shyness of the qubit itself.
