## INTRO
- The development should move in the direction of big data and the algorithms that that data solves.
- The algorithm that would determine the complexity of big data could range from a few Megabytes to a few Petabytes, the data itself, while the algorithms should be solved by distributed systems of networked computers. From Level Up, to Level Out.

## Technologies
- ANSI C (.c)
- LISP (.lisp)
- BASH (.sh)
- GHOST LNG (.gh)

## Development
- Abstract (Matrix)
- Hyper (Speed)
- Out of box (Diferent thinking)
- Out of logic (Unlogical- Quantum)
- Quantum bit (Qbit)

## Quantum Logic

Quantum computers functionally use the quantum properties of microparticles. In classical computers, 
information is basically represented in the form of bits (0 and 1) where one information at a time 
can be either 0 or 1. In quantum computers, the basic units of operation are qubits (qbit), which use
the quantum superposition phenomenon and other quantum properties for information operation. This means 
that the qubit can have multiple states of zero and one (0, 1, 01, 00, 10, 11), because each of these 
states can be in superposition, which gives the qubit multidimensionality. What is interesting about 
the quantum bit is that it can have a possible state (0, 1, 01, 00, 10, 11) only and exclusively only 
if we do not observe it. The moment we start observing it, it transforms into a state of ordinary bit, 
where only zero or one state is possible. This means that quantum calculations take place outside our 
perception, and the moment we get involved in requesting that information that the quantum computer 
has processed, we actually get only a simple bit as output. According to some, this happens, among other 
things, because the human brain and body are not ready or accustomed to the state of particle superposition. 
It can be understandably said that this phenomenon is a matter of shyness of the qubit itself.
