## We are Society

Society is a set of people, who have the same goal and vision. We work together 
on amazing projects as an open source team. Morality and ethics come first. Our 
goal is to unite whitehat hackers and create a community that will contribute 
to the progress of humanity. Society should be resistant to this dirty way of 
using the network. Touch the future.
