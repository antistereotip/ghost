## Intro

The ghost protocol serves to improve the security layers of the network. 
It is not based on basic encryption, but on options that go beyond silicon. 
Ghost is quite close to hardware and can therefore be considered a low 
level tool. The primary technology for the development of the ghost protocol 
is the ANSI C programming language. Ghost ensures that information finds its 
way from point a to point b and that it is almost impossible to notice the 
content traveling through the network. This is some small introduction to 
modern technology in the old school way.

## Idea

The idea is to map the data. Folders 4 to 32 contain nibbles. Let's say 
folder 4 contains only 1 nibble and it is an aggregation of four bits. 
Folder 32 contains 8 nibbles. There are a total of 8 folders for bit logic. 
Each is larger by one nibble. For now, there are only three logic gates, 
NOR, XOR and NAND. The combination of nibbles and logic gates provides many 
possibilities, as well as the combination with combined logic gates. It is 
necessary to create an "invisible" protocol that will be called as an API. 
The three logical gates represent three layers. The interlayers are 1.5 and 2.5. 
The interlayers are in charge of interference. The basic idea is that the ghost 
protocol works through light, because it is impossible to hack light. By combining 
nibbles and logic gates, combinations are obtained that are predictable until 
they are encrypted. It will be possible to call Ghost from the / home folder as 
a script with the extension .ghost (.gh) and when calling that session all traffic 
will be "invisible" and actually invisible. Interference will prevent the content 
from being visible to anyone with any hardware. If the protocol happens to work as 
written, it will be the first invisible protocol in the history of the Internet and 
will be a major step forward for all of humanity.

## Development

Development is based on fast methods, mostly ANSI C programming language. 
Some parts are bash scripts and some logic will be written in LISP. 
Ghost protocol does not use any databases. It is completely flat file oriented. 
The ravine is divided into three parts or layers. The first layer is what 
the user wants to do and call the protocol as a request. The second layer 
maps all request positions and moves the request to a dedicated container 
located in the 'nix platform file system. The second layer is closed information. 
The third layer is keyless delivery, but the recipient must also send a protocol 
request to receive the information. What happens between these three layers can be 
called the primary logic of the Ghost protocol. if we have layers 1, 2 and 3, 
Ghost would have to be at 1.5 and at 2.5. These two layers are invisible even 
to the system, because the user, by invoking the protocol request, grants 
privileges to the interlayers. The development platform is GNU / Linux. 
Encryption is performed adapted to a method that is not widely used. Let's 
just call it a codebook.

## The use of

We see the use of the ghost protocol as a widely used method of data transfer. 
Ghost is still in the test phase and the reason why it has not yet been released 
for widespread use is because the development is in the cubes that need to be 
put together. The protocol has been tested and has shown some results that are 
not yet final. We also see use in large corporations where corporations will 
have to set aside a certain amount of money for a protocol with support. If people 
want to use it without support, it is completely open to use as open source. 
The main use of the protocol is user privacy.

## Ethic

The protocol requires great ethical predispositions. The project is completely 
open source and anyone who wants to develop a project must be a proven whitehat 
ethical hacker. The idea behind the whole project is a fully distributed system 
that is aimed directly at the user and gives him complete privacy and freedom. 
Development will go in the direction of ethics and morals and a completely 
avant-garde way of designing.

## How to contribute ?

Please send your contact information and github or bitbucket account to the 
e-mail: milutingavrilovic@gmail.com and I will inform you as soon as possible 
how we need to develop the protocol. The only condition for the development 
team is a pure whitehat approach. Development Engineers should have a basic 
knowledge of low level programming as well as an elementary understanding of 
cryptography.
