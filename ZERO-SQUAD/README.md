## Zero Squad - Final Detachment.

### Zero Squad.

*Only 4 nibbles can be core of Zero Team.*

- The Zero Squad is the ultimate squad to deal with the dark internet. The dark layers of the internet carry with them a lot of malice and the task of the zero detachment is to integrate into the deepest layers of the internet. Zero Squad is an elite whitehat unit established with the goal of fighting the dark side of the network. We cooperate with several whitehat organizations and those organizations will remain anonymous for the efficiency of cooperation. If you want to become a member of the Zero Squad, you need to use encrypted services in combination with the ghost protocol. Only 4 members can be the core of the team. These are nibbles that are the same in the mirror: 0000, 1111, 1001, 0110. The other nibbles are a continuation of the command line in sequence. There are 12 more. All 16 nibbles are the core plus the continuation of the chain of command. All 16 combinations are associated with hexadecimal notation and are developed in parallel with the ghost protocol. The Zero Detachment was determined to have 1111 members. Let's say that member 0211 is not in nibble logic, he is actually two hundred and eleven (211) member out of a total of one thousand one hundred and eleven (1111) members. 1111 members receive commands from 16 members that are in nibble logic. And 12 members out of 16 get commands of 4 members, while zero member or 0000 makes the final decision.

- 0000 is comand line interface (master nibble) - Priority - [0]
- 1111 is second line interface (sec line nibble) - Priority - [1]
- 1001 is shell interface (shell nibble) - Priority - [2]
- 0110 is also shell interface (shell nibble) - Priority - [2]
- Comandline interface for executing by priority: [0] -> [1] -> [2], [2] :

### Down The Rabbit Hole

- The logic of integration into the dark side of the network requires encrypted tunnels and strong encryption. 
- Identity must not be compromised.
- Please use VPN and TOR, and best solution is Tails OS.
