*Only 4 nibbles can be core of Zero Team.*

- The Zero Squad is the ultimate squad to deal with the dark internet. The dark layers of the internet carry with them a lot of malice and the task of the zero detachment is to integrate into the deepest layers of the internet. Zero Squad is an elite whitehat unit established with the goal of fighting the dark side of the network. We cooperate with several whitehat organizations and those organizations will remain anonymous for the efficiency of cooperation. If you want to become a member of the Zero Squad, you need to use encrypted services in combination with the ghost protocol. Only 4 members can be the core of the team. These are nibbles that are the same in the mirror: 0000, 1111, 1001, 0110. The other nibbles are a continuation of the command line in sequence. There are 12 more. All 16 nibbles are the core plus the continuation of the chain of command. All 16 combinations are associated with hexadecimal notation and are developed in parallel with the ghost protocol. The Zero Detachment was determined to have 1111 members. Let's say that member 0211 is not in nibble logic, he is actually two hundred and eleven (211) member out of a total of one thousand one hundred and eleven (1111) members. 1111 members receive commands from 16 members that are in nibble logic. And 12 members out of 16 get commands of 4 members, while zero member or 0000 makes the final decision. Fisrt member of squad 0000 and last member 1111 have the same priority. They start and stop sircle of command. It's ghost ciclus of life. The detachment aims to decrypt everything that is encrypted. All top secret labels should become public after performing the tasks of the zero detachment. More precisely, everything that is hidden in the encryption should become public.
- For decryption of all encrypted data we need quantum computer power. We will use theory of Maxwell Demon. Let's take the example of coffee with two colors of sand, yellow sand and gray sand. We will take a spatula and mix the sand. The moment we stir the sand, there is no reversible process to get it all back the way it was. Now we will return to Maxwell's demon and see how it is possible to defy irreversibility, ie how we can report a reversible process (at least theoretically). This theory tells us, if true, that quantum physics has the power of reversibility, which could solve the decryption of the most complex cryptographic algorithms. So, we still have a bowl with a partition in the middle and a small door that divides that bowl into two parts. We said that we have faster and slower particles and that we have a demon on the side that observes and assigns values ​​and moves the particles from one side to the other and vice versa. We want to create a reversible process..

- We'll give the demon a notebook and a pen. He won't be able to use the eraser. The condition is that he writes down every value of every particle in that notebook and that his pen is not used up, but also that the notebook has an infinite side. He would start writing down the values of a particle in order and change the positions of that particle in speed (moving from one part of the vessel to another and vice versa). If he used an eraser and erased only one particle velocity value, he would break the possibility of returning everything as it was (the process would be irreversible), but theoretically if he wrote everything down and did it right and defied the law of thermodynamics, and wanted to return everything as was, to return everything to an autonomous state, but also to return the thermodynamic law, he would have to return each particle to its place in order and continue with the observation. As a result, it would get a reversible process in its entirety and there is actually the power of quantum physics.

- Conclusion. Super quantum computers could break every possible secret in the world in a short time (all TOP SECRET tags would become public - PUBLIC) because any asymmetric but also symmetric algorithm would be broken in a very short time and all tags under the veil of secrecy would be revealed. . That would be a great advance for humanity. FULLSTOP.

- 0000 is comand line interface (master- core) - Priority - [0]
- 1111 is second line interface (second line - core) - Priority - [1]
- 1001 is shell interface (under priority - shell) - Priority - [2]
- 0110 is also shell interface (under priority - shell) - Priority - [2]
- Comandline interface for executing by priority: [0] -> [1] -> [2], [2] :


## Zero Detachment first 16 members in chain of command:

- 0000 [core]
- 1111 [core]

### Tools:

- The logic of integration into the dark side of the network requires encrypted tunnels and strong encryption. 
- Identity must not be compromised.
- Please use VPN and TOR, and best solution is Tails OS. Or just Customize Your Debian.
